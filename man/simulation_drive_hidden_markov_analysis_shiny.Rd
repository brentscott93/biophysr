This is an interactive plot of the running variance and running mean (the exact data the model uses).
Shaded regions are the events identified by the Hidden Markov Model.




Below is an interactive plot of the raw data (model does not use this data).
The overlay is the Hidden Markov Model 'state' prediction (via Viterbi Algorithm) multipled by several conversion factors.
These convert the x-axis 'time' from windows to data points to seconds.
The HMM state, baseline mean, and measured step size are used to scale the overlay to each step and subsequent baseline.


Plots of the running mean and the running variance.
This is a useful way to see how the model decides what is an event or baseline.
