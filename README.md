![](bp3.png)


biophysr is an R package/shiny app for automating the analysis of single molecule biophysics data for the Muscle Biophysics Lab. The packages key function is app() which launches a shiny app locally on the users computer. Alternatively, users can by-pass the shiny app and use the biophysr functions in their own R-scripts. Each biophysr function has two versions - one for the shiny app and one for regular use in an R-script.
