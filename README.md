Update: This package is deprecated. Development has moved to the {lasertrapr} package. 


biophysr is an R package/shiny app for automating the analysis of single molecule biophysics data for the Muscle Biophysics Lab housed at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The package's key function is app() which launches a shiny app locally on the users computer. Alternatively, users can by-pass the shiny app and use the biophysr functions in their own R-scripts. Each biophysr function has two versions - one for the shiny app and one for regular use in an R-script.
